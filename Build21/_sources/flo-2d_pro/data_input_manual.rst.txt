Data Input Manual
=================

The original Data Input Manual was created in Adobe InDesign, and the layout does not convert cleanly into 
reStructuredText or online documentation. For this reason, the manual is provided in PDF format.

The Build 25 Data Input Manual is fully included in this documentation so it can be referenced and linked by ChatGPT and other automated tools.
