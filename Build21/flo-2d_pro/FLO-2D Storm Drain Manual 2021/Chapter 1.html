<h2><span class="section-number">1.1. </span>FLO-2D Storm Drain Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#flo-2d-storm-drain-overview" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Initially, the FLO-2D PRO two-dimensional flood routing model was integrated with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Storm Water Management
Model (SWMM) Version 5.0.022 (Rossman, 2005; Rossman, Lewis A., 2006; Rossman, Lewis A., 2007) starting in 2013.
The FLO-</p>
<p>2D storm drain engine has evolved into a completely new and unique model component.
The FLO-2D storm drain engine simulates the exchange of surface water flow with a storm drain system as a flow continuum (one body of water).
Over the years, as the storm drain code expanded, the original SWMM source code became obsolete, and the FLO-2D storm drain system represents a
significant advancement in storm drain detail, accuracy and speed.</p>
<p>In the coupled model system FLO-2D hosts the closed conduit storm drain system and both models run simultaneously as one engine.
FLO-2D calculates all hydrologic and hydraulic flood routing while the closed conduit component computes the pipe hydraulics.
The integration process involves allowing both systems to share data on a computational timestep basis controlled by the FLO-2D surface water engine.
The storm drain inlet discharge and the potential return flow to the surface is a function of the water surface elevation (WSE) and the storm drain
pressure requiring a seamless sharing of data.
Both systems must have the same coordinate data base.
The FLO-2D model will compute the storm drain inflow discharge based on the predicted grid element headwater depth and inlet geometry type.
This inlet-controlled discharge will then be routed as storm drain pipe discharge.
The storm drain return flow to the surface water system is exchanged through storm drain inlets/outlets and outfalls.
The complete conceptualized flood routing system is shown in Figure 1.</p>
<img alt="../../_images/Chapte0023.jpg" src="../../_images/Chapte0023.jpg" />
<p><em>Figure 1.
Conceptualized FLO-2D Model System with a Storm Drain Component.</em></p>
<p>The FLO-2D storm drain component can be visualized in layers.
The surficial layer represents all the surface water flood movement which is connected to the subsurface pipe layer through the pipe junctions defined
as inlets (or outfalls).
Figure 2 illustrates the layered system.</p>
<img alt="../../_images/Chapte0212.png" src="../../_images/Chapte0212.png" />
<p><em>Figure 2.
Volume Exchange between the Surface Water and Storm Drain System</em></p>
<p>The FLO-2D storm drain component can be applied to a variety of different storm water projects including:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Assessment of the storm drain capacity;</p></li>
<li><p>Existing storm drain system response to floods events;</p></li>
<li><p>Design (sizing) of flood control and drainage system features;</p></li>
<li><p>Analysis of urban surface features (levees, walls, streets, channels) and their impact on the volumes captured by the piping system;</p></li>
<li><p>Design strategies to minimize storm drain overflow.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The FLO-2D storm drain system data base can be developed using the FLO-2D QGIS plug-in tool, the EPA SWMM Graphical User Interface (GUI) or other
external SWMM software programs.</p>
<p>The SWMM GUI is installed with the FLO-2D Pro Model installation package.
The only requirement is to be able to generate the SWMM.inp Version 5.0 data file.
To run the storm drain model, the switch in the FLO-2D model data base must be activated or turned ‘on’ (FLO-2D Control Variables Dialog).
This can be accomplished in the FLO-2D model Grid Developer System (GDS) or in the QGIS plug-in.
Once the storm drain system is built and the run switch is set, the flow into and through the pipe system is simulated automatically when the FLO-2D
model is started.
Following a successful simulation of the surface water and storm water integrated model, the storm drain results can be reviewed in either the QGIS,
GDS (Figure 3) or in the EPA SWMM GUI.
Junctions are shown in green and Inlets are blue.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">1.2. </span>FLO-2D Storm Drain Model Enhancements<a class="headerlink" href="#flo-2d-storm-drain-model-enhancements" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The enhancements to the original SWMM model are extensive.
Some of the enhancements are related to the water surface head on the storm drain system.
The original SWMM model did not predict or utilize surface water elevation.
The FLO-2D model computes the storm drain inlet inflow discharge based on the inlet geometry and the head on the inlet and shares the discharge with
the storm drain engine.
The inlet and outfall exchange with the surface water including return flow to the storm drain system are based on the comparison between the water
surface elevation and the hydraulic head not just the rim elevation.
There are a number of enhancements to the outfall functions.
Finally, there have been a number of enhancements made to both model codes that include timestep management, inlet geometry, manhole covers, storm
drain return flows, reporting output, and feature options.</p>
<section id="computational-timesteps">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.2.1. </span>Computational Timesteps<a class="headerlink" href="#computational-timesteps" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The storm drain routing timestep in the original SWMM model was based on one of several methods that the user selected.
The FLO-2D surface water engine computational timesteps were typically smaller than the storm drain model timestep requiring several successive FLO-2D
computational timesteps to be completed to match the simulation time of the storm drain model.
During periods of successive FLO-2D timesteps, the volume of water entering the storm drain system from the surface water model was accumulated.
Once storm drain simulation time was exceeded, the host FLO-2D model activated the storm drain-surface water interface and the block of surface water
was distributed into the storm drain system.</p>
<p>The update interval between the models was essentially the storm drain dry timestep (DRY_STEP) which was hardwired to 60 seconds.
The FLO-2D discharge to the storm drain for each computational timestep was accumulated as a volume over the update interval and then was divided by
the update interval time to derive a steady discharge exchange from FLO-2D surface water to the storm drain.
The flow between the models could only be in one direction, either inflow to the storm drain system or return flow to the surface water.
Oscillations occurred when the surface water and storm drain conditions force the inflow and return flow to alternate with large blocks of water.
In addition, a storm drain feature may fill and drain repeatedly even though there may be only inflow to the storm drain system and or only return
flow to the surface water.</p>
<p>A new timestep synchronization method was implemented, and the surface water and the storm drain systems now communicate at each FLO-2D computational
timestep.
The storm drain system uses the FLO-2D computational timestep for the water volume exchange as well as for the flow routing through the pipe system.
With the more frequent water volume exchange at each FLO-2D computational timestep, the inconsistencies between the volumes leaving the surface water
and entering the storm drain system were eliminated.
The storm drain routing timestep is set up as the FLO-2D timestep for the dynamic wave solution throughout the simulation for all conditions, if the
user sets up a fixed timestep or if the user assigns a variable timestep.</p>
<p>In most of the simulations, the FLO-2D timesteps are small enough for the storm drain solution to converge.
For all conditions, the computed variable timestep is equal to the FLO-2D computational timestep.</p>
</section>
<section id="inlet-geometry">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.2.2. </span>Inlet Geometry<a class="headerlink" href="#inlet-geometry" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>In the original SWMM model, pipe discharge was based on the system conveyance capacity, ignoring the inlets discharge capacity (control).
The FLO-2D storm drain model computes the storm drain inlet discharge based on the storm drain inlet geometry and the predicted water surface
elevations.
An inlet can be assigned to a floodplain, channel or street element.
Three inlet options represent typical storm drain inlet designs.
A fourth option enables a stage-discharge rating table for a unique inlet conditions (INTYPE= 4) and a fifth option will simulate a manhole
(INTYPE=5).</p>
<p>The EPA SWMM5 model introduced a ponding feature to enhance the flooding approach used by the EPA SWMM 4 model.
The purpose of this feature was to emulate surface water that would both keep the excess storm drain water under pressure and return flow to the
system when storage capacity became available.
The ponding feature is activated when the inlet storm drain pressure head exceeds rim elevation.
Two overflow conditions were evaluated by the SWMM model when the pressure head exceeds the rim elevation:</p>
<p>Flooding: Originally developed in EPA SWMM Version 4, excess volume in the storm drain overflows and is lost because there is no inlet temporary
storage.
Hydraulic head at the node will not rise above the inlet rim + surcharge depth.
This approach is a simplification that ignores the additional surface water head that may force more water to move through the pipe system.</p>
<p>Ponding: This routine was created to represent a surface water layer in the EPA SWMM 5 model.
Inlet overflow is stored at the node until such time when the pressure head is reduced below the rim elevation and the stored volume is released back
to the storm drain system.
In this case, the overflow volume is never lost from the storm drain system.
Ponded nodes do not contribute any volume to the surface water and in the flow routing continuity report any remaining ponded volume at the end of the
simulation is reported as Final Stored Volume.
The ponded volume continues to increase with more inlet overflow (return flow).
To enable return flow, the catch basin pressure head must exceed the rim elevation plus surcharge depth (manhole cover).
The rate of the rise in the pressure head depends on multiple factors including the available ponded area.
There is no maximum ponded volume.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>The global ponding options was off and none of the nodes could store volume.
The flooding option was applied for this case.</p></li>
<li><p>The Allow Ponding option was selected, and those nonzero ponded area nodes would receive ponded water.
Nodes with a zero-ponded area would receive flooding water.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>When an inlet is flooded, the computed depth will decrease to the rim elevation and the overflow lost from the system is considered excess inflow into
the node.
For a ponded node, the depth is based on volume divided by the ponded area.
The smaller the assigned ponded area, the higher the water rises and drains.
The ponded area affects how quickly ponded water reenters the storm drain system because it defines the pressure head at node.
The program accounts for the ponded volume so the pressure head can be computed for the next time step.</p>
<p>EPA SWMM5 ponded routine represents an unrealistic condition where the storm drain water under pressure exceeding the rim elevation is accumulated at
an inlet but does not return to the surface water to flow away from the inlet.
This is because the SWMM model cannot route surface water.
Since the FLO-2D model routes the surface water and predicts flood hydraulics, the SWMM ponding feature was modified.
Consideration was given to the fact that no inflow should occur during flooding conditions in the storm drain.
If the inflow to inlet is ceased at the moment there is no storm drain capacity, discharge oscillations can physically occur.
This is an actual response of the storm drain system to the surface water.</p>
<p>There are two pressure conditions that had to be assessed in the revised ponding feature:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>FLO-2D WSE &gt; storm drain pressure head &gt; rim elevation:</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The conduit water volume under pressure stays in the pipe and the return volume is assigned to the drop basin pipe based on its flow area.
No volume is lost from the storm drain system to the surface water and the volume stays in the pipe.
The pressure head in the storm drain is correctly represented for this condition.
For the second condition:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>FLO-2D WSE &lt; storm drain pressure head &gt; rim elevation</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>When the storm drain pressure exceeds the surface water elevation, the water should overflow the inlet and join the surface water to be routed away
from the inlet and there is no storage volume in the pipe system.</p>
<p><em>Surface Water – Storm Drain Exchange Conditions:</em></p>
<p>When the storm drain capacity is exceeded and is under pressure, the return flooding volume becomes part of the surface water in the FLO-2D model if
the pressure head exceeds the FLO2D water surface elevation.
When an inlet has orifice flow and the flow depth is higher than the curb height, water is pouring into the storm drain pipe.
As the storm drain fills and the pipe water surface approaches the inlet rim elevation and there is a rapid increase in pressure head in the catch
basin.
When this occurs, oscillations may be noted in the storm drain pressure and discharge plots.
With this modification to the storm drain code, the conditions that control the inlet flow direction described below and shown in Figure 4 through
Figure 11:</p>

<p>This approach for the water exchange between the surface and the storm drain may result in pressure head variability, conduit velocity fluctuations
and different return flow results for inlets and manholes under pressure when compared with SWMM models or early FLO-2D storm drain models.
The following response can be observed in the FLO-2D storm drain results:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The head on the inlet continuously increases when the PH is less than the FLO-2D WSE even though the head exceeds the rim elevation.
Since the inlets are flooded, this results in higher storm drain pressure.
The volume above the rim is not released to the surface until the PH exceeds the FLO-2D WSE.</p></li>
<li><p>For underwater inlets, the higher-pressure head pushes more water through the downstream conduits at higher velocity.</p></li>
<li><p>Higher velocities in downstream conduits may result in higher discharges in various locations in the storm drain with a possible corresponding
reduction in the return flow to the surface water for some inlets and manholes.
Maintaining continuity in the storm drain system, there may be sufficient head to force the flow to the outfalls instead of overflowing the inlets and
manholes.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Summarizing, higher upstream pressure head on inlets (higher FLO-2D WSE) may result in a change in the distribution between the return flow from a
popped manhole or inlet compared the downstream conduit flow through the outfall nodes.
This is a physical process that was not simulated in the original SWMM storm drain engine.</p>
</section>
<section id="outfall-discharge">
<h2><span class="section-number">1.6. </span>Outfall Discharge<a class="headerlink" href="#outfall-discharge" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The FLO-2D preprocessor tool (QGIS or GDS) will create the SWMMOUTF.DAT containing the outfall nodes that are defined in the SWMM.inp file.
The outfall discharge to the surface water can be turned ‘on’ = 1 or ‘off’ = 0 in the QGIS Storm Drain Editor dialog window (Components | Outfalls)
or in the GDS dialog window (Tools | Storm Drain | View Outfall Nodes Dialog).
Setting the outfall switch to ‘off” will force the outfall discharge out of the model system.
The outfall nodes listed in the SWMMOUTF.DAT file should be in the same order as they appear in the SWMM.inp file, if any of the features for the
storm drain system is changed, data files need to be recreated to maintain consistency.
When the outfall order is modified in the SWMM.inp, because either a new outfall node was created or deleted from the pipeline system, the
SWMMOUTF.DAT should be regenerated with the GDS.
If the outfall switch is ‘on’, the FLO-2D water surface elevation and storm drain pressure head are compared, and the outfall will discharge to the
surface water until the FLO-2D water surface elevation is equal to or greater than the pressure head.
Potential backflow into the outfall pipe depends on the comparison of the water surface elevation and the outfall pressure head, and on the assignment
of a Tide Gate structure in the SWMM.inp file.
Outfall discharge from storm drain to the FLO-2D surface water is reported to the SWMMOUTFIN.OUT file.
This file lists the grid element (or channel element if applicable) in the first line followed by the hydrograph with time and discharge pairs.</p>
<p>The invert elevation of outfalls can be less than the floodplain, channel or street elevations.
This may occur for a ponded surface water condition that is assigned as a ground elevation because it would not contribute to downstream flooding.
An outfall invert underground (or underwater) is imposed for this condition (Figure 12).
An artificial head equal to the ground elevation is assigned to the outfall node (for the entire simulation).
This artificial head causes the pipe to fill, and the artificial volume is accounted for in the storm drain model.
When the model runs, the inflow may be added to either the outfall grid element or the upstream storm drain pipe network and the flow can go either in
or out of the outfall pipe based on the pressure head.</p>

<p><em>Figure 12.
Initial Condition for an Underground (Underwater) Storm Drain Outfall</em></p>
<p>Typically, an outfall has an invert elevation equal to or greater than the floodplain, channel or street elevations.
To account for volume conservation, the storm drain outflow that represents inflow volume to a FLO-2D channel is reported in the CHVOLUME.OUT file.
Water will flow in or out of the outfall pipe based on the head comparison.
Water can enter the storm drain when the water surface elevation is greater than the invert, but it can also be evacuated from the storm drain if the
pressure head is above the water surface elevation.</p>

<p>A storm drain inlet can be simulated as an outlet with a flapgate to stop the surface water from entering the storm drain system (Type 4 inlet).
The flapgate switch in SWMMFLO.DAT has the following settings:</p>
<pre>

Feature = 1, No flapgate – vertical inlet opening
Feature = 2, Flapgate ‘on’ for fake outfalls

<p>The manhole cover lift-off (popping) is simulated by assigning the surcharge depth in the SWMMFLO.DAT file (Type 5 inlet).
When the cover is in place there is no flow exchange.
Discharge exchange between FLO-2D and the manhole cover junction box is calculated only after the manhole cover has been popped.
To pop the cover, the storm drain pressure plus surcharge depth is compared to the surface water.
Once the cover is off, the surcharge depth is set to 0, the cover stays off and inlet discharge or return flow can be calculated.
Flooding occurs at manholes when the pressure head at node is above manhole invert + maximum surface depth + surcharge depth.</p>
<p>SDManholePopUp.OUT and ManholePop.OUT are created when at least one manhole pops in the storm drain system.

<h2><span class="section-number">1.9. </span>Curb Inlet Flow Adjustment<a class="headerlink" href="#curb-inlet-flow-adjustment" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>For each timestep, the FLO-2D grid element water surface elevation (flow depth) is used to calculate the discharge that passes through the inlets
using the weir and orifice equations as well as the geometry of the inlets defined by the user in the SWMMFLO.DAT file.
This uniform water surface elevation over the grid element does not take into consideration a street cross slope and thus will under predict the flow
into the drain.
Using an assumed 2% street cross slope results in a higher depth (more head) on the storm drain inlet (see Figure 13 and Figure 14).
The curb height can be entered in the SWMMFLO.DAT file to make this adjustment automatically for each inlet.
The curb inlet flow assignment is the same concept as the Street Gutter Flow feature (requires GUTTER.DAT file) that can be applied to gutters in
streets without storm drain inlets.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">1.10. </span>Storm Drain Pressure Head Variation Dampening<a class="headerlink" href="#storm-drain-pressure-head-variation-dampening" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>In the original SWMM model, to avoid rapid pressure fluctuation that induces discharge oscillations in the drop boxes, the storm drain engine had a
pressure dampening algorithm.
This algorithm used the surface area of the lateral conduit connected to the drop box.
As the conduit water surface elevation approached the soffit, the algorithm applied a decreasing water surface area.
Once the flow reached the soffit, the pressure head dampening method is applied for a distance above the invert of 1.25 times the conduit pipe
diameter.
The surface area was then exponentially reduced to the drop box diameter as the flow filled the catch basin over the prescribed distance.
The justification for this dampening routine is that the pressure head change in one computational timestep may be sufficient to fill a four-foot drop
box causing both oscillation and volume conservation error.
In reality, during a storm this may occur as evidenced by manhole popping or spraying of water from inlets.</p>
<p>To more effectively represent the physical system, the pressure head dampening routine was reviewed and several options to revise the dampening
algorithm were evaluated including allowing the pressure head variation up to be exponentially reduced over to entire drop box to the rim elevation.
The Figure 17 through Figure 20 display water profiles and the pressure head versus time for an upstream inlet that has an inflow condition that fills
the vertical pipe above the rim elevation.
This example shows how the pressure head calculation is affected for three different dampening methods when the pressure head exceeds the soffit
elevation.
The selected method allows the pressure head to be exponentially reduced over to entire drop box to the RIM elevation.</p>

<p>It is noted that the Flood Control District of Maricopa County (FCDMC) in Phoenix, Arizona recommends this approach for flooding and drainage studies,
but it should not be applied for storm drain design.
In a design project the storm drain features are oversized to provide enough capacity for clogging.

<p>Flow energy losses are experienced when a conduit or conveyance facility has change in size or geometry.
There is contraction in the flow area between the catch basin of an inlet (vertical pipe) and the inlet.
The sudden contraction at the inlet from the drop box pipe diameter results in an energy loss in the return flow from the storm drain to the surface

<p>h<sub>L</sub> = local energy loss per unit length of pipe</p>

<p>These equations are solved for the discharge Q and head H in each pipe by setting the initial conditions for H and Q at the beginning of the
simulation as well as setting the boundary conditions at the beginning and end of each conduit for all timesteps.
For each pipe, the geometry (flow area A) is known as a function of the flow depth y and head H.
Unsteady flows are routed through a network of closed conduits.
Unsteady flow with backwater effects, flow reversals, pressurized flow with entrance/exit energy losses and other conditions can be simulated
(Rossman, 2005).
The momentum equation inertial terms are reduced as flow comes closer to being critical and are ignored when the flow is supercritical based on the
following options:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Damping option (KEEP) - inertial terms of the St.
Venant equation solution are included.</p></li>
<li><p>Ignore option (IGNORE) - inertial terms are ignored.</p></li>
<li><p>Dampen option (DAMPEN) - implements Local Partial Inertial modification (LPI).</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>For the FLO-2D model the LPI damping option is always applied.
The simulation of unsteady flows with subcritical/supercritical mixed flow regimes is accomplished by neglecting varying portions of the inertial
terms in the unsteady momentum equations according to the local Froude number.
A weighting factor σ which ranges between 0 and 1 is utilized.
This parameter damps out the contribution of the inertial terms as the Froude number Fr increases and approaches 1.0 and ignores them completely when
the Froude number is greater than 1 (supercritical flow).
The weighting factor 𝜎 varies as:</p>
<pre>
            σ = 1.0                 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝐹𝑟 < 0.5

            𝜎 = 2.∗ (1.−𝐹𝑟)       𝑓𝑜𝑟 0.5 ≤ 𝐹𝑟 ≤ 1.0

            𝜎 = 0.                  𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝐹𝑟 > 1.0
</pre><p>The inertial terms are multiplied by σ when they are added into the solution of the momentum equation for each timestep and conduit.
The Froude number is calculated at the midpoint depth in the conduit.
This solution (DAMPEN) produces more stable results around the critical stage of the flow, but retains the essential accuracy of the fully dynamic
solution at sub-critical flow conditions.</p>

<p>The differential form of the continuity and momentum equations for the storm drain component are solved by converting them into an explicit set of
finite difference formulas that compute the flow Q in each conduit and head at each node for time T + t.
Explicit schemes for these types of solutions are limited to minor steps by strict numerical stability criteria.

<p>The average area 𝐴̅, hydraulic radius 𝑅̅, and velocity 𝑉̅ are computed using the heads H1 and H2 at either end of the conduit from which corresponding
flow depth values y1 and y2 can be derived.
An average depth <em>y</em> is then computed by averaging these values and is used with the cross-section geometry of the conduit to compute 𝐴̅ and 𝑅̅.
The average velocity 𝑉̅ is determined by dividing the most current discharge by the average flow area.
A limitation on this velocity is coded to prevent unbounded frictional flow adjustments.
As a consequence, the velocity cannot be higher than 50 ft/sec.</p>
<p>For a conduit with free fall discharge into either of its end nodes, the depth at the end of the conduit for the node below the invert elevation of
the conduit is set equal to the smaller of the critical depth and the normal flow depth for the conduit flow.
The equation to calculate the head adjustment term for each timestep at each node is:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-flo-2d-pro-flo-2d-storm-drain-manual-2021-chapter-1-12">

<p>where ∆Vol is the net volume flowing through the node over the timestep.
The net volume is computed as:</p>

<p>The conduit surface area (A<sub>store</sub>) depends on the flow condition within the conduit as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Under normal conditions the pipe surface area equals half of the conduit length times the average of the top width at the end and mid points of the
conduit.
These widths are evaluated before the next updated timestep using the flow depths y1, y2, and y.</p></li>
<li><p>If the inflow of the conduit to a node is in free-fall (conduit invert elevation is above the water surface of the node), then the conduit does not
contribute to the node surface area.</p></li>
<li><p>For conduits with closed shapes such as circular pipes that are greater than 96 percent full, a constant top width equal to the width when 96 percent
full is used.
This prevents the head adjustment term H<sub>t</sub> from creating numerical instability as the top width and corresponding surface area approach zero
when the conduit reaches a full condition.
A minimum surface area for A<sub>store</sub> is assigned to all nodes, including junctions that normally have no storage volume, preventing H<sub>t</sub>
from becoming unbounded.
Under normal conditions A<sub>store</sub> equals half the conduit’s length times the average of the top width at the end- and mid-points of the conduit.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>These widths are evaluated before the next updated flow solution is found, using the flow depths y1, y2, and y discussed previously.
The default value for this minimum area is 12.57 ft<sup>2</sup> which corresponds to the area of a 4-foot diameter manhole.</p>
<p>To calculate the discharge Q and the head H, the equations are solved for each timestep using a method of successive approximations with under-
relaxation (Rossman, 2005).
The solution algorithm involves the following steps:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic">
<li><p>A first estimate of discharge Q in each conduit at time <em>t+</em>Δ<em>t</em> is calculated by solving for Q<sub>t+∆t</sub> using the heads, areas, and

<li><p>A first estimate of the head (H) in each conduit at time <em>t +</em> Δ<em>t</em> is calculated by evaluating H<sub>t+∆t</sub> using the discharge Q just computed.
The results are denoted as:</p>
<p>Qlast and Hlast</p>
</li>
<li><p>The equation Q<sub>t+∆t</sub> is solved once again, using the head, area, and velocity based on the Q<sub>last</sub> and H<sub>last</sub> values just
computed.
A relaxation factor Ω is used to combine the new flow estimate Q<sub>new</sub> with the previous estimate Q<sub>last</sub> to generate a new Q<sub>new</sub>
according to the equation:</p>
<blockquote>

</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>The equation for H<sub>t+∆t</sub>is solved again for heads using Q<sub>new</sub>.
As with discharge, this new solution for head, H<sub>new</sub> is weighted with H<sub>last</sub> to produce an updated estimate for heads:</p>
<blockquote>

</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>If H<sub>new</sub> is close enough to H<sub>last</sub> then the process stops with Q<sub>new</sub> and H<sub>new</sub> as the solution for time t + Δt.
Otherwise H<sub>last</sub> and Q<sub>last</sub> are replaced with H<sub>new</sub> and Q<sub>new</sub>, respectively and the process returns to step 2.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The procedure uses the following parameters and conditions for this iterative procedure:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>A constant relaxation factor Ω equal to 0.5.</p></li>
<li><p>A convergence tolerance of 0.005 feet on nodal heads.</p></li>
<li><p>Number of trials is limited to four.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The flow depth in conduits that are not surcharged is limited not to exceed the normal flow depth for the discharge at the upstream end of the conduit
whenever the flow regime is supercritical.
FLO-2D storm drain model uses the water surface slope and Froude number to determine when supercritical flow occurs in a conduit.</p>

<p>Floodplain runoff discharges from the surface layer typically only enters the pipeline system at inlets.
Weir and orifice equations are used to calculate an inflow discharge under inlet control.</p>
<p>In the original SWMM model there was no inlet control and all the water in the subcatchment was made available to the storm drain system capacity.
With inlet control, the inlet discharge is based on the inlet geometry and on the comparison between the FLO-2D water surface elevation and the storm
drain pressure head.
The inlet discharge is imposed as surface water boundary conditions (BC) and is passed to the storm drain layer for routing.
The following equations (Johnson and Fred, 1984) are used:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Weir Flow:</p>

<p>H = FLO-2D grid element water depth that contains the inlet structure</p>
<p>m = 1.5 for a broad crested weir. This is hardcoded.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Orifice Flow:</p>

</div></blockquote>
<p>The discharges are calculated based on the physical behavior of the inlet as a weir or an orifice for a given timestep and the smaller of the two
discharges is used in the surface water exchange to the storm drain system.
Using orifice flow accounts for the gutter velocity that would reduce the weir flow discharge.</p>

<h4><span class="section-number">1.14.1.2. </span>Surface Water – Storm Drain Model Integration<a class="headerlink" href="#surface-water-storm-drain-model-integration" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>The FLO-2D model moves around blocks of water on a discretized grid system.
Grid elements assigned as inlets/outfalls connect the surface layer with the closed conduit storm drain system.
A comparison of the grid element water surface elevation with the pressure head from the closed conduit system node in a given cell determines the
direction of the flow exchanged between the two systems.
The models are fully integrated on a computational timestep basis.</p>
<p>The advantages of the FLO-2D storm drain component over the original SWMM model are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Complete surface water hydrology and hydraulics including rainfall runoff, infiltration, and flood routing in channels, streets or unconfined overland
flow are simulated by FLO2D surface water model.</p></li>
<li><p>The storm drain component solves the pipe hydraulics and flow routing but integrates the inlet/outlets and outfalls with the surface water at each
computational timestep.</p></li>
<li><p>FLO-2D computes the storm drain inlet discharge based on the water surface head and the inlet geometry.
The original SWMM model did not consider inlet control.</p></li>
<li><p>Only those junctions set up as inlets/outfalls in the storm drain model are recognized for system exchange.
Pipe junctions without an inlet will not receive a surface runoff discharge.</p></li>
<li><p>The inlet locations digitized in storm drain data files (*.INP) are automatically read by the FLO-2D GDS to establish the storm drain inlet
connections.</p></li>
<li><p>Inlets can become outlets if the storm drain pressure head exceeds the grid element water surface elevation at a given node.
The potential return flow to the surface water is based on the water surface elevation not the rim elevation as in the original SWMM model.</p></li>
<li><p>Manhole covers can pop and allow return flow based on a surcharge depth representing the manhole cover weight.
Once popped the manhole surcharge is turned ‘off’ and the manhole functions as an inlet/outlet for the rest of the simulation.
This is an improvement over the original SWMM model.</p></li>
<li><p>For outfall nodes in the closed conduit system network, pipe discharge can be removed from the storm drain system or returned to the surface water as
a user defined option.
The outfall can function as an inlet to the storm drain system based on the surface water elevation.
A tide gate can be used to prevent inflow to the outfall.
The integration of the outfall boundary conditions with surface water represents an enhancement over the original SWMM model.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>To integrate the surface water and storm drain models, the first task is to develop a running FLO-2D surface water flood model.
Then the storm drain model can be built with the assigned inlets/manholes/outfalls for surface water exchange.</p>

<p>Pumps are links used to lift water to higher elevations.
A pair of nodes can be connected using links as pumps.
The flow through a pump is computed as a function of the heads at their end nodes.
Pumps can be simulated in FLO-2D as part of the storm drain system or as a hydraulic structure in the surface model.
They have to be set up based on the following considerations:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>The pump curve can specify flow as a function of inlet node volume, inlet node depth, or the head difference between the inlet and outlet nodes.</p></li>
<li><p>The pump discharge is limited to the inlet inflow during a given timestep.
This will eliminate the possibility of the pump curve being sufficient to drain the inlet node during the time step.</p></li>
<li><p>An ideal transfer pump can be specified where the flow rate equals the inflow rate at its inlet node and no curve is required.
In this case, the pump must be the only outflow link from its inlet node.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The parameters for a pump in the storm drain system are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Names of the inlet and outlet nodes</p></li>
<li><p>Pump curve name</p></li>
<li><p>Initial status ‘on’ or ‘off’ status</p></li>
<li><p>Startup and shutoff depths</p></li>

<h3><span class="section-number">1.15.9. </span>Flow Regulators<a class="headerlink" href="#flow-regulators" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Flow regulators are devices used to divert flow and can be applied to control releases from storage facilities, prevent surcharging or convey flow to
interceptors.
They are represented as a link connecting two nodes.
The flow regulator discharge is computed as a function of the head at the end nodes.
Most of the flow regulators devices control the surface flow, as a consequence they have be simulated using the surface features, example: a ponded
area with a weir structure that drains to the storm drain system.
The storm drain model can simulate a regulator as a storage unit with a weir.
The ponded area belongs to the surface layer; therefore the correct method is to simulate this using a depressed storage area in the surface grid with
a Type 4 inlet connecting the storage facility with the storm drain system.</p>
<p>There are some specific configurations where the flow regulators control the storm drain flow.
For these cases, the flow regulator feature has to be simulated in the storm drain layer.
An example is a large catch basin with an opening in the inlet wall (orifice).
This component belongs to the storm drain layer and it needs to be modeled as a storage unit with an orifice.</p>

<section id="orifices">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.15.10. </span>Orifices<a class="headerlink" href="#orifices" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Orifices are used to model outlet and diversion structures.
These outlet orifices should be distinguished from the inlet orifice flow and are typically openings in the wall of a manhole, storage facility, or
control gate.
They can be either circular or rectangular in shape and can be located either at the bottom or along the side of the upstream node.
They can have a tide gate to prevent backflow.
Orifice flow is based on the following criteria:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p>When fully submerged the classical orifice equation is used:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>D = height of the full orifice opening</p>
<p>h = hydraulic head on the orifice</p>
<p>C<sub>d</sub> = discharge coefficient hardcoded to 0.67</p>
<p>g = gravitational acceleration</p>
<p><em>f</em> = fraction of the orifice that is submerged</p>

<section id="weirs">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.15.11. </span>Weirs<a class="headerlink" href="#weirs" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>A weir is an unrestricted overflow opening oriented either transversely or parallel to the flow direction.
Weirs can be a link connecting two nodes where the weir itself is placed at the upstream node.
A flapgate can be included to prevent backflow.
The weir calculations are based on the following criteria:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p>When the weir becomes completely submerged, the model switches to the orifice equation to predict flow as a function of the head.</p></li>
<li><p>Weirs do not contribute any surface area to their end nodes.</p></li>

<p>is used to compute the discharge as a function of head <em>h</em> across the weir when the weir is not fully submerged.</p>
<p>where:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>C = the weir coefficient</p>
<p>L = the crest length</p>
<p>m = an exponent that depends on the type of weir being modeled: lateral, transverse, side-flow, V-notch
, or trapezoidal. Typically, m = 1.5 for a lateral weir. This exponent is hardcoded in the FLO-2D storm drain model.</p>

<section id="outlets">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.15.12. </span>Outlets<a class="headerlink" href="#outlets" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Outlets are used to control discharge from storage units or to simulate special stage-discharge relationships that cannot be characterized by pumps,
orifices and weirs.
They can have a flapgate that restricts the flow to only one direction.
This option does not discharge to the FLO-2D surface water system.</p>
