Storm Drain Plots
=================

Use this tab of MapCrafter to create plots of different storm drain
output data for individual nodes and links.

The plots are saved as ``*.png`` files in the MapCrafter folder, for
example:

``Project Folder/MapCrafter/Storm Drain/Links/Percent Full``

.. image:: ../img/sd_2.png

The **See Results** button will open a simple image viewer to rotate
through the different views.
