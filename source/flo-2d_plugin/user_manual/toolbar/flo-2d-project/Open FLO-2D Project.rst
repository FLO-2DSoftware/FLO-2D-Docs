Open FLO-2D Project
====================

This button is used to open an existing FLO-2D GeoPackage. If the FLO-2D GeoPackage is not updated, the FLO-2D Plugin
automatically updates the GeoPackage to the latest version.

Open an existing FLO-2D GeoPackage
-----------------------------------

.. Important:: Do not drag and drop a GeoPackage file onto the map.  Load it using this button.

1. Click on the Open FLO-2D Project button.

2. Select the GeoPackage \*.gpkg file.

.. important:: The latest FLO-2D plugin does not have a \*.qgz file.  Only a \*.gpkg file is needed.  This makes it
               easier to move a project to a new folder.

3. If the GeoPackage is updated, FLO-2D Plugin prompts a message to load the project. Click OK.

Update an outdated FLO-2D GeoPackage
--------------------------------------

5. If the GeoPackage is outdated, FLO-2D Plugin will ask the user to update it.

6. Click Yes to update or No to cancel.

7. The project with the updated GeoPackage will be loaded.

.. note::  The outdated GeoPackage will not be deleted or altered. The FLO-2D auto-port functionality creates a new
           GeoPackage and adds data to it with the current FLO-2D Plugin version as suffix to the new GeoPackage.
