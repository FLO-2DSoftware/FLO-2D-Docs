FLO-2D Info Tool
==================

Use the Info Tool to identify data in the User Layers and Schematic Layers.
The layers must be active and checked on in the Layers panel.
This tool also activates the Profile Tool widget.

Layers that work with this tool:

-  Channel layers

-  Left bank

-  Cross sections

-  Structure layers

-  Levee layers

This tool is a toggle.  Toggle it on to activate it and toggle it off to stop using it.

Channel Profiles
----------------

1. Click  
   the FLO-2D Info Tool.

3. Click a left bank schema line.  This option will plot the profile of the channel and load the bank and invert data
   into the table panel.

4. Use the  
   Profile Tool widget to select the data plot source.

5. In this example, the  
   elevation raster is the y axis and the left bank length is the x axis.
