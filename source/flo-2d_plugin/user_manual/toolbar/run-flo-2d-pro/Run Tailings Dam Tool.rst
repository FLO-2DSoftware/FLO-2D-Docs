Run Tailings Dam Tool
======================

The FLO-2D Tailings Dam Tool is designed to estimate the potential release volume of tailings.
Leveraging site-specific and historical data, the tool predicts the likelihood of tailings dam failure
and projects the associated release volume. Users can refine their analysis by selecting a discharge and
sediment concentration hydrograph, providing valuable insights for risk assessment and planning.
