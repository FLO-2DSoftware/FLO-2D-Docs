Run MapCrafter
===================

FLO-2D MapCrafter is a QGIS plugin designed to transform FLO-2D output files into comprehensive visualizations.
It generates flood maps for single-phase simulations, sediment maps, mudflow maps, and two-phase simulation flood maps.
Additionally, MapCrafter goes beyond by creating hazard maps, highlighting areas with elevated risks based on FLO-2D
simulations, aiding in risk management. The plugin also streamlines the QGIS layout manager process by automatically
generating templates for easy customization.
