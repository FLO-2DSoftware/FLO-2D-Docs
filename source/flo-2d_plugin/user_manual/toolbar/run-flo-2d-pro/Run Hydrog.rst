Run Hydrog
===================

Hydrog is a post-processor  program  to  display  channel  and  cross  section
hydrographs.

.. note:: The project folder must have a CONT.DAT file to run Hydrog.  A complete simulation with either a channel,
          floodplain cross sections, or hydraulic structures results.

.. note:: Hydrog functions are all available using the FLO-2D Plugin.
