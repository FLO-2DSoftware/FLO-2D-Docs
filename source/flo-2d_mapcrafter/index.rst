FLO-2D MapCrafter
==================

FLO-2D MapCrafter is a QGIS plugin designed to transform FLO-2D output
files into comprehensive visualizations. It generates flood maps for
single-phase simulations, sediment maps, mudflow maps, and two-phase
simulation flood maps. Additionally, MapCrafter goes beyond by creating
hazard maps, highlighting areas with elevated risks based on FLO-2D
simulations, aiding in risk management. The plugin also streamlines the
QGIS layout manager process by automatically generating templates for
easy customization.
