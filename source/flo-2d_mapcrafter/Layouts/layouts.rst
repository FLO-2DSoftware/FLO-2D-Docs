Layouts
=======

FLO-2D MapCrafter can automate the creation of QGIS maps by using a
predefined map layout. This feature is called **FLO-2D Layouts**.

Map Information
---------------

Map Title
~~~~~~~~~

Write the title of your map. Example: “FLO-2D Flood mudflow extent area”

Map Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write a description of your map. Example:

“The Mudflow Extent Map provides a detailed visualization of areas
susceptible to mudflow events based on FLO-2D simulations. This map
highlights the extent of potential mudflow occurrences, offering
valuable insights for risk assessment and mitigation strategies.”

Select Layer Extent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Select the extent of the layer that will be used for mapping. It is
recommended to select the Computational Domain, but any layer can be
selected.

Map Layouts

FLO-2D A4 & A3 Landscape
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Example of the FLO-2D A4 & A3 Landscape layout. The legend should be
added by the user, and small adjustments on the scale or other objects
should be performed by the user.

FLO-2D A4 & A3 Portrait
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Example of the FLO-2D A4 & A3 Portrait layout. The legend should be
added by the user, and small adjustments on the scale or other objects
should be performed by the user.
