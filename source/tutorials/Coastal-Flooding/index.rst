**Course Overview**

The **FLO-2D Coastal Training Course** equips professionals with essential skills in coastal modeling using FLO-2D.
The course focuses on simulating coastal processes, such as tides and storm surges, with an emphasis on flood risk
assessment and mitigation strategies.

**Course Objectives**

- **Understand Coastal Hydrodynamics:** Learn key coastal processes, including tides and storm surges.
- **Master FLO-2D Tools:** Use specialized FLO-2D tools for coastal modeling, including complex urban scenarios.
- **Simulate Coastal Flooding:** Model extreme weather events to assess flood risks.
- **Integrate Real-World Data:** Apply topographic and meteorological data for accurate simulations.
- **Develop Mitigation Strategies:** Use simulation results to plan effective flood mitigation.

**Who Should Attend**

Ideal for engineers, planners, and scientists in coastal management, flood risk assessment, and disaster mitigation,
this course provides valuable insights and practical experience with FLO-2D.

**Prerequisites**

Basic knowledge of hydrology and hydraulic modeling is recommended, but not required.
Familiarity with FLO-2D or similar modeling software is advantageous.

**Course Materials**

Participants will receive comprehensive training materials, including user manuals, datasets, and hands-on videos.

**Training Certificate**

The course spans approximately six hours, of hands-on exercises. Once finished, please submit your final summary.out
file to FLO-2D staff for a Certificate of Completion.
